# Project-Files
Repository to store files and links for projects created in personal time

If ipynb files are not loading in Github, paste the link for them in this tool and they'll render properly: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.  This is a [known Github issue](https://github.com/iurisegtovich/PyTherm-applied-thermodynamics/issues/11).
